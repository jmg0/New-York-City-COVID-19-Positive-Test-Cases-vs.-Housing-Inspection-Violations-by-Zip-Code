# New-York-City-COVID-19-Positive-Test-Cases-vs.-Housing-Inspection-Violations-by-Zip-Code

This analysis is a preliminary look into the relationship between substandard housing and health outcomes in New York City. Substandard housing was, in this case, defined as housing having received an inspection violation from the New York HPD in the last year. Health outcomes were determined by the number of confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 up to the present date. HPD violations and positive cases of COVID-19 were each totaled by zip code for analysis.

The regression analysis determined a correlation coefficient r = 0.5196. In other words, there is a moderate positive correlation between substandard housing as defined in this analysis and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a given zip code.

NOTE:
This analysis is not yet adjusted for population differences across zip codes, which is a major confounding variable.
